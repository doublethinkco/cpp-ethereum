    // "The Crypto++ SHA-3 implementation dates back to January 2013 when NIST
    // selected Keccak as SHA-3. In August 2015 NIST finalized SHA-3, and it
    // was a modified version of the Keccak selection. Crypto++ 5.6.2 through
    // 5.6.4 provides the pre-FIPS 202 version of SHA-3; while Crypto++ 5.7
    // and above provides the FIPS 202 version of SHA-3.
    //
    // See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3
    //
    // This means that we will never be able to move to the CryptoPP-5.7.x
    // series of releases, because Ethereum requires Keccak, not the final
    // SHA-3 standard algorithm.   We are planning to migrate cpp-ethereum
    // off CryptoPP anyway, so this is unlikely to be a long-standing issue.
